# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.
The game is set in the cave and the main goal is to escape the cave with the treasure which is protected by a number of monsters in one of the rooms. It is dark in the cave and the flashlight is mostly needed to navigate through it. Flash light battery may die but also recharged by picking new batteries. Player has energy level that diminishes as they move or do other things in the cave that draws energy. To keep the energy up, the tip is to intake some food and water that are found in some areas in the cave. One other tip is to type "help" to get reminded about the possible commands. Simply to win:
    Player should not exit the cave without the treasurer, run out of energy or exhaust the battery to zero.
