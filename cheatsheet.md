This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

For our game here are the valid commands :
 - go [north/south/east/west] 
 - turn [on/off] flashlight 
 - change flashlight battery 
 - view inventory 
 - pick up [item] 
 - put down [item] 
 - eat [food]

The valid item names are as follows: 
 - flashlight 
 - granola bar 
 - dried fruit 
 - water bottle 
 - knife 
 - battery 
 - treasure 

Other than those, the code will tell the player to try again since it did not understand the player's command.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.


# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

 - The game is set in the cave and the main goal is to escape the cave with the treasure which is protected by monsters in one of the rooms. To get the treasure, the player must find the knife and kill the monsters. 

 - It is dark in the cave and the flashlight is needed to navigate through it. If the player's flashlight battery runs out, they die. The flashlight can be recharged with a fresh battery that is found in the cave. 

 - Player has energy level that diminishes as they move or kill monsters. If the player's energy runs out, they die. To keep the energy up, the tip is to intake some food and water that are found in some areas in the cave.
